        <h1>South Asian Jazz Musicians</h1>
        <div class="arch">
            <p>South Asian Jazz Musicians is a platform dedicated to showcasing contemporary artists who are redefining South Asian music. In the 1950s and 1960s, South Asian musicians greatly influenced jazz by incorporating Indian musical elements, as seen in albums like John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme," reflecting his interest in Indian ragas and modal improvisation. Today, artists continue to push boundaries, creating a rich tapestry of sounds that honor tradition while exploring new frontiers in musical expression.</p>
